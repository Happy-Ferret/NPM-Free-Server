# NPM-Free-Server

This is a **very tiny** server. Without comments it is **50 lines of code** and it's **less than 1KB** when minified.

You do not need to use `npm install` to use this. You just need Node installed. Feel free to modify it for you project.

### How to run the server:

1. Install [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org)
2. `node server.js`

If you're on windows you can just double-click the `server.bat` (file if you don't like typing).
